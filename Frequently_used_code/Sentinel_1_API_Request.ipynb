    "Sentinel Hub is a multi-spectral and multi-temporal big data satellite imagery service, capable of fully automated archiving, real-time processing and distribution of remote sensing data and related Earth Observation products.It is an engine for processing of petabytes of satellite data that opens the door for machine learning and helping hundreds of application developers worldwide. It makes Sentinel, Landsat, and other Earth observation imagery easily accessible for browsing, visualization and analysis. Sentinel Hub is operated by Sinergise company that have developed enterprise level spatial solutions for governmental clients in Europe and Africa. Sinergise is headquartered in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and has subsidiaries in Czech Republic, Moldova and Serbia. More information on Sentinel Hub can be found [here](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/explore).\n",

Main applications are for monitoring sea ice, oil spills, marine winds, waves & currents, land-use change, land deformation among others, and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes. Sentinel Hub currently supports Sentinel-1 Level-1 GRD (Ground Range Detected) products only."

It provides access to raw satellite data, rendered images, statistical analysis and much more.In order to access and use sentinel hub services through API calls, the user needs to take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Register to  [Seninel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/) portal \n",
    "- [Authentication](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/#/API/authentication)\n",
    "- [Process](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/#/Evalscript/) \n",

    "To access data user needs to send a request to process API. The requested data will be returned as the response to this request. Each request can be tailored to get the user exactly the data that was requested. To do this requires setting various parameters which depend on the data source the user is querying. The following examples help the user to understand the parameters for S1GRD data. To explore more examples of such requests go [here](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/#/data/Examples_for_S1GRD), and for an overview of all API parameters see the [API Reference](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/reference/)."
